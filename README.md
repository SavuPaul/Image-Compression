### Task 1: Compression with Matrix Score Check (`-c1`)

In Task 1, the program reads data from a `.PPM` file and stores it in a `Matrix` variable, which contains fields for red, green, and blue values. Each node in the quadtree has three fields: `line`, `column`, and `size`, allowing easy mapping between a node's position in the tree and its corresponding pixel area.

The function `matrix_score` checks if the mean value for a given submatrix is less than or equal to the compression factor. The process proceeds as follows:

1. **Initial Matrix Score Check**: If the score of the entire matrix is greater than the compression factor, the matrix is not divided further, and the required data is written to the output file.

2. **Recursive Division**: If the matrix can be divided, the process continues recursively until the right child of the root has its `done` field set to 1. A node's `done` field is set to 1 if all its descendants (submatrices) have been divided until their score is less than or equal to the compression factor. In other words, a node is marked as done if all its descendants have `done` set to 1.

3. **Division Process**: In each loop iteration, the children of a node are processed from left to right. If any child can still be divided, the algorithm traverses that childâ€™s subtree and then moves to the next child. This is possible due to pointers to parent nodes. When `qtree->right->done` equals 1, the image is fully divided, and the quadtree is complete.

#### Output Functions
- **`maxheight`**: Calculates the number of levels in the quadtree.
- **`countLeaves`**: Returns the number of leaves, equivalent to the number of matrix regions with a mean value <= compression factor.
- **`highestLeafLevel`**: Finds the closest leaf to the root and stores its level in the `level` variable. By knowing the leaf's level and the image size, the size of the largest image region with a mean value <= compression factor can be determined through successive division by 2.

### Task 2: Compression Tree Formation and Binary Output (`-c2`)

In Task 2, the compression tree is formed following the steps from Task 1. The resulting tree structure is then written to a file in binary format.

1. **Binary Output**: The image size is first written to the file. The `level_traversal` function then performs a level-order traversal of the tree. Using the `check` variable, leaf nodes are assigned a `type` value of 1, while internal nodes are assigned a `type` value of 0. `level_traversal` writes this data to the output file.

### Memory Management

After completing both tasks, all allocated memory is freed, including the pixel matrix and the quadtree. The `freeTree` function handles the deallocation.

This program effectively compresses images by constructing a quadtree based on pixel similarity, resulting in a hierarchical structure that can be stored efficiently and used for further analysis or compression.
